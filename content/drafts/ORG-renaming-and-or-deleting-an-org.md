# Renaming and/or Deleting an Org

This page will cover how to handle a situation where you need to delete
or rename an Organization.

<hr/>

## Renaming an Organization

There is currently no way to rename your Organization from the web or 
CLI interface.

Currently, to functionally "rename" an Organization, the following
needs to happen:

- Create a new Organization with the name you want.
- Re-setup billing.
- Re-add members.
- Re-create teams.
- Re-assign package access.

If you find yourself in this situation, the Organization Owner should
[contact npm Support] as they have tools to help you migrate your existing
Organization setup.

## Deleting an Organization

# What is npm?

npm opens up an entire world of JavaScript talent to you and to your team. It's the world's largest software registry, with approximately 3 billion downloads per week.The registry contains over 600,000 _packages_ (building blocks of code). Open-source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages. Packages are structured to enable you to keep track of dependencies and versions. 

Here is a quick introduction to npm:

npm consists of three distinct components:

*  the website
*  the registry
*  the Command Line Interface (CLI)

The [*website*](https://npmjs.com) is the primary way to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of your npm experience. For example, you can set up npm Orgs (organizations) to share access to packages. 

The *registry* is a large public database of JavaScript software and the meta-information surrounding it. If you would prefer to have a private registry, consider [npm Enterprise](https://www.npmjs.com/enterprise). npmE allows your company to maintain its own registry, for internal software development.

The [*CLI*](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) runs from a terminal. This is how most developers interact with npm. 

Basic npm accounts are free; you can upgrade to a paid account to get more features. 

## Use npm to . . . 

* Adapt packages of code to your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
* Download standalone tools you can use right away.
* Run packages without downloading using [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx).
* Share code with any npm user, any where.
* Restrict code to specific developers.
* Form Orgs (organizations) to coordinate package maintenance, coding, and developers.  
* Form virtual teams by using Orgs.
* Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.
* Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.
* Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle. 
* Find other developers who are working on similar problems.  

These are just a few examples of ways developers use npm. If you'd like to add a bullet point, comment [here](https://github.com/npm/docs/issues/944).   

## Next Steps

Now that you know what npm is, and a bit about how to use it, it's time to get started.  If you have a macintosh, run or install a terminal console that you like. If you have a machine running Windows, learn some basics about how to launch and use Windows shell. Next, find a text editor you like, and you will be ready for the next chapter. 

[Install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). We look forward to seeing what you create!

### CLI Reference Doc / Online Help

While relevant CLI commands are covered throughout this user documentation, the CLI includes command line help, its own [documentation section, and instant help (man pages)](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/help). When you click a doc about [any CLI command](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/help-search), a list of all CLI commands appears in the left-hand side bar. You can also access the list of CLI commands by scrolling down [the first docs page](https://docs.npmjs.com/docs).
